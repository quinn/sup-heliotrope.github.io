<pre>hi,

i'd like to introduce what i am working on and some ideas that i have for sup.

first of all, i was very enthusiastic when i discovered sup (i was checking out
a fork of mutt, which was including notmuch, which was inspired by sup. the
mutt fork or notmuch were not really interesting to me, but sup is!)

i have been using mutt since more than 15 years, and in recent years i have
been running more and more into limitations.
i knew knew right away that sup could be a platform to overcome those
limitations. i was even more delighted when i found out that several of the
mutt limitations i ran into are already solved in sup.

ongoing work:
add support for a &quot;new&quot; state that is different from unread.
  the idea here is that the new state of a message can be cleared without
  reading the message or marking it as read. this distinction is important
  because i have lots of old unread mail, and so i can't see where i have
  actual new mail.
  i don't want to mark everything as read because occasionally i am searching
  for an old message where i read about something specific, which is hard if i
  can't tell the difference between what i read and what i didn't read. 
  not to mention that it is very hard to mark 500+K messages as read.

use the use-mail branch and fix problems as i discover them.
  i stumbled into this by accident. i tried use-mail because current stable and
  develop branches have problems on debian 6. as a result i discovered that the
  use-mail branch is stable enough for my needs. since this branch is
  inevitably the way forward given that RMail is dead, i figured that my time
  is better spent fixing my problems here, and avoid RMail alltogether.

some ideas:
    i'd like the ability to apply a label change to all messages that match a
  given search, not just the ones loaded into the buffer.

  i have imported a lot of uncategorized messages from my mutt inbox, and i
  want to make use of sup's tagging to group them. instead of loading all
  messages in a search with !! it would be nice to just let sup tagg those
  messages in the background.

    i am using procmail still to prefilter mail. it's going to take a while to
  switch to a sup based filtering, and i am not sure i even want that, at least
  not until sup can reliably filter mails into folders.

  procmail also filters spam, and in sup those sources are automatically tagged
  as spam. my spam filters are aggressive, and do have false positives. sup
  should be able to determine that any message that is a reply to a known
  non-spam message is also not spam, and should thus not apply the spam label
  to this message.

  the same goes for any message from an email address that i have sent mail to.
  iaw, all my contacts should automatically be whitelisted.

    occasionally, when writing mail i need to look up something in other mails.
  with mutt i &quot;solved&quot; this by running two instances of mutt in parallel. (the
  main reason for that was to be able to switch between the inbox and other
  folders without having to reload the inbox all the time. sup solves that part
  nicely by allowing me to switch between buffers.)

  so what i want here is some way to switch back and forth between vim and sup.
  possibly this can be done with tmux or screen by opening vim in another
  window.

    i'd like to treat saved searches as virtual folders. they should be in a
  combined list with labels, and i'd like to be able to open them by typing the
  name in the search prompt.

    related to this and above, i'd like to auto-label searches. instead of
  writing a hook, i'd like to just say: always label messages matching this
  search, and have sup generate the necessary hook by itself

  i have some more ideas that don't come to mind right now.

you can find my work on <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/embee/sup">https://github.com/embee/sup</a> in the use-mail and
work-in-progress branches.

greetings, martin.
