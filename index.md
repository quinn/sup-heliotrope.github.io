## # [sup](https://github.com/sup-heliotrope/sup/)
[Sup](https://github.com/sup-heliotrope/sup/) is a console-based email client for people with a lot of email.

It presents an interface of a list of threads, which are each hierarchical collections email messages.
Threads can have multiple tags applied to them.
It supports a very fast full-text search, automatic contact-list management, custom code insertion via a Ruby hook system, and more.
If you're the type of person who treats email as an extension of your long-term memory, Sup is for you.

More documentation on getting started [is available in the wiki.](https://github.com/sup-heliotrope/sup/wiki#installation)

## # Features
 * Handle massive amounts of email.
 * Fast, local full-text index of messages.
 * Mix email from different sources: mbox files and maildirs.

 * Organize email with user-defined labels, automatically track recent contacts, and much more!

## # Sub-projects
### [sup](https://github.com/sup-heliotrope/sup)
[sup](https://github.com/sup-heliotrope/sup) is the original curses email
client, full-text index, and hook system.

### [Heliotrope](https://github.com/sup-heliotrope/heliotrope)
[Heliotrope](https://github.com/sup-heliotrope/heliotrope) is an architectural
shift from sup that maintains many of the same concepts, but separates out a
server and client.
Contrast to what is done in sup, where one large client installation has all
the mail documents and indexes locally, Heliotrope provides a server-side
service that indexes mail.

In this way, remote clients can connect up and interact with their mail stores
in a sup-like way, while keeping the mobile install slim.
This is a lifesaver when switching from machine to machine.

### [Turnsole](https://github.com/sup-heliotrope/turnsole)
[Turnsole](https://github.com/sup-heliotrope/turnsole) is an example client
that would connect to Heliotrope and interact with mail.
